I have learnt a lot of new things since I started this assignment last week, some of the things I have learnt so far are;
1.The meta tags and thier importance in the html 
The Meta tags are HTML tags that provide information about a webpageâ€™s content to search engines and users.
Meta tags are  added in the <head> section of your HTML. 
The meta description tag provides a short description of the page.It is he description shown in sarch results.
The meta viewport tag controls how the webpage is displayed on mobile devices.
e.g is shown below;
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
There are other useful meta tags.

2.I have alsolearnt about how the display flex property is used in div elements to produce the output you are looking for.
I have been exposed to the various properties that can be attributed to a flex element in css
This includes the flex wrap that indicates whether there should be a wrap when space is too small
Another property is the flex direction  which can either be coumn or row, and column reverse or row reverse.
The flex grow, flex shrink property also  indicatrs hoe the flex element should expand and shrink respectively depending
screen width.
3. I have also learnt a little bit of responsive design such that the design of some elements f the website changes when there is a reduced screen width.
In my website there is a responsive design feature that makes the footer background color change when the website is opened on screen sizes
less than a maximum and certain features removed . This is very nice as responsive design creates a suitable design for different media.
